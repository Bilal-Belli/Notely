# Notely (Desktop Application)
> Notely is a Desktop application developed by Bilal Belli in 2024.

> The goal is to help students use a smart keynote tool that allows them to stay focused, take notes, and draw diagrams. This is more productive than using a web browser that can waste your time on social media. And this is helpful for doctoral researchers to read scientific papers.
